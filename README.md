Hypertables creates a simple UI to perform CURD actions on your database and tables, inspired by AirTable and Excel.

Hypertables Flavour PHP provides the PHP backend that will work with the database executing the actions.

The project is based on Larvel, one of the most popular PHP frameworks out there.
